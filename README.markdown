## 🎮 What is CartPole?

Imagine a circus act where a cart zips left and right to keep a pole upright. That’s **CartPole**! The agent observes the cart’s position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity, deciding whether to push left or right to maximize balance time. It’s a classic RL problem that’s simple yet profound, teaching the AI to make split-second decisions in a dynamic environment.

## 🛠️ How It Works

This project is a symphony of code and creativity, orchestrated in a Jupyter Notebook. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Environment Setup**: We initialize the CartPole-v1 environment from Gymnasium, rendering it as RGB frames for visualization.
2. **PPO Model**: A PPO model with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy learns to balance the pole through trial and error.
3. **Custom Visualization**: A bespoke `VisualCallback` class paints a vivid picture of the cart and pole, updating in real-time with state info (cart position, pole angle, and rewards).
4. **Training & Evaluation**: The agent trains for 10,000 timesteps, with periodic evaluations to track performance and save the best model.
5. **Testing Showcase**: Load the trained model and watch it perform, with frames saved as a mesmerizing test video.
6. **Reward Plot**: A sleek Matplotlib plot visualizes the mean reward over time, highlighting the AI’s learning curve.
